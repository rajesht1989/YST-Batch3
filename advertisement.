ðŸŽƒDescription:
          ðŸ‘“ Advertising is always present, though people may not be aware of it. In today's world, advertising 
             uses every possible media to get its message through. It does this via television, print (newspapers, 
             magazines, journals etc), radio, press, internet, direct selling, hoardings, mailers, contests, sponsorships, 
             posters, clothes, events, colours, sounds, visuals and even people.
             
          ðŸ‘“ The advertising industry is made of companies that advertise, agencies that create the advertisements, media that
             carries the ads, and a host of people like copy editors, visualizers, brand managers, researchers, creative heads 
             and designers who take it the last mile to the customer or receiver. A company that needs to advertise itself and/or 
             its products hires an advertising agency. The company briefs the agency on the brand, its imagery, the ideals and values
             behind it, the target segments and so on. The agencies convert the ideas and concepts to create the visuals, text, layouts 
             and themes to communicate with the user. After approval from the client, the ads go on air, as per the bookings done by the 
             agency's media buying unit.
