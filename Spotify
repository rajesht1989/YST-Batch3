About Spotify:
            Spotify is a legal way to stream music online and listen to podcasts. The company licenses tracks from major and minor record labels for its extensive music library. 
            It pays the rights holders an undisclosed amount based on the number of times people listen to each track.
 Listening to music on Spotify is entirely free, but you see banner ads within the official apps and hear the occasional audio ad between songs as a trade-off.
 You can listen to entire albums on Spotify in addition to playlists curated by Spotify staff, artists, and other users. 
 Likewise, you can create Spotify playlists and share them.
If you want to remove ads, you can pay for Spotify Premium, a paid membership that removes all advertising from the apps, enables song downloading for offline listening, and more.
